### Hello 👋
I'm Rahul, a full stack software developer in NYC. 

I build weird things, whether they are scripts or full stack applications.

I primarily use React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for full stack, and Python for everything else,
though I also have experience with Next.js and Vite. 

I am currently looking for full-time software engineering roles, specifically those hiring new grads. 

Feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUHZqbmvDYuNnZakG59eNmmY5pyxOg9l/view?usp=sharing) or contact me at rahulsarker14@gmail.com
